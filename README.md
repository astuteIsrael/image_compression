# Image Compression Tool

This project is a Python-based image compression utility that allows users to reduce the size of image files without significant loss of quality. The script uses the `Pillow` library for image processing and `tkinter` for a graphical file selection dialog.

## Features

- **User-Friendly File Selection**: Choose your image file using a simple graphical interface.
- **JPEG Compression**: Convert and compress images to JPEG format with adjustable quality.
- **Optimization**: The output image is optimized to reduce file size further.

## Requirements

- `Pillow` library (fork of PIL)
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python)
